# In The Net
## Summary

In The Net is a website that encourages people who have an interest in netball to sign up to the social league. This league is based in Havering, one of London’s North-East boroughs and it’s a social league that is suitable for all skill levels to join, including non-experienced players. In The Net is also useful for teams to see where they are ranking in the league and when their next game is.

## Features
### Existing Features
* Navigation Bar
    * The navigation bar is featured across all pages on the website, in the same format for consistency and to provide a professional look. 
    * This section includes the name and logo of the social league “In The Net”, as well as the tagline “The Havering Social Netball League”. The tagline was included in this section to give new visitors instant awareness of what this website is about and where the league is located.

* The Homepage Image
    * The main landing image that is featured across the multi-device screens, instantly reinforces that this website is centered around netball only. 
    * Given this image was pre-available on Shuttershock, there were limitations on the image size to fulfill a desktop greater than 1440px, as it would have distorted the photo. To ensure this issue doesn’t happen again, I would need to have new photos taken at wide angles, to allow for multiple screen sizes.

* The Review Section
    * To encourage users to sign up, In The Net quotes 5-star reviews from players who have joined the league.
    * It consists of 3 reviews, so the page is not cluttered, but enough to give the page visitor a sense of comfort that this league is real and trustworthy, can improve their netball playing skills and an opportunity to meet new people.

* Additional Netball Images
    * Depending on the screen size you are viewing the website on, there are up to 3 images featured mid-way on the homepage. 
    * In the first photo, you can see a group of girls of different ethnicities on the ground celebrating their win. It was important to include this photo, as it shows the social netball league is inclusive of all races.
    * The second photo is a court image during the day. This is to show potential players what their court may look like, depending on the venue their game is at. Given that it looks aesthetically pleasing, it may encourage players to sign up, so they too could play on this court.
    * The third photo is an image of older ladies playing, approximate age of 30-40 year old women. This is to encourage older players to sign up to the game, given that they are unlikely to be the only older player in the league and have the confidence to sign up.

* How to play netball
    * It was important to include a summary video on how to play netball. For players who are interested in the sport, but have never played, this is a great opportunity to understand the rules and positions, so they can feel player ready when it comes to their first game.
    * For players who haven’t played the sport in a while, this video acts as a quick refresher on the rules and positions. This is so they can rely less on their coaches or umpires for an update on the rules and where on the court they are allowed to go.

* USPs of Signing Up
    * This section shows a quick statement accompanied by relevant icons to reinforce why users should join the league.
    * It was important to focus on what would be an attention-grabber for new players, such as:
    * Having qualified umpires and coaches. Having umpires and coaches available at the games is helpful for new players as they can ask them any questions that they are unsure about, which helps them pick up the game very quickly.
    * Providing equipment such as bibs. Therefore, there is no need for anyone to  purchase one for themselves or their team.
    * They can win prizes if they do well in the league. People enjoy incentives and prizes for the most part, so this will encourage players to bring their A-game, even if it is a social league.
    * Telling potential players that there are indoor and outdoor courts. On the next page “Fixtures & Results”, it states what venue your game will be at and whether it’s indoor or outdoors. This lets players prepare ahead of time what they should wear for the match. For example, whether they should wear tracksuit bottoms because it’s cold and they’re outdoors, or shorts if they are indoors.
    * All abilities are welcomed. This lets inexperienced players and players of any disability feel comfortable to sign up because the league caters for everyone.

* Call to Action
    * This call to action, “Come join us” is to encourage those who are interested to sign up for the league straightaway, without having to scroll back to the navigation bar. It includes a hyperlink within the paragraph text where “Sign up” is and this directs users to the “Sign Up” page.
    * Additionally, if any users have any questions, they can also email the customer care team and they will be willing to answer any questions.

* Footer
    * The footer is available on all pages and it is fixed to the bottom of the page, so the page visitor would need to scroll to the end of the page to see it.
    * The footer provides information that the page visitor may need, such as company info, if they want to check if the business is legitimate via Company House, contact details, such as telephone, email and address and it also includes In The Net’s social pages. The social pages provide proof that the league is real and it can help build a reputation and trust as it uploads more content from a company point of view and from players submitting their photos to be posted.
    * Each social network icon opens up to their respective pages on a new tab.

* Fixtures & Results Landing Page Image
    * This image is keeping to the theme across the website using images from netball. It includes a cover text that instantly let’s players know what game is upcoming based on today’s date and the next game to be played. This would ideally be dynamic, so the correct information is always displayed.

* Netball League Results
    * Based on the teams that have signed up to the league and how well they have performed, the top 10 teams will be featured here in ranking order from 1st to 10th. 
    * There is a key below the table to let page visitors know what the abbreviated terms mean.
    * Points are calculated based on Goal Difference “GD” multiplied by 3. For every goal difference a team gets in their favour (must not be a negative number e.g., -5), they will receive 3 points. So the aim is to minimise your opposition team's scoring and win as many goals as possible. 
    * Matches played lets everyone know how many games they have left in their league. The league consists of 10 matches each. However, if a team does not show up to a game, it counts as a match played, but they will forfeit and their opposing team will receive an automatic 5 Goals For “GF”.

* Upcoming Netball League Fixtures
    * This table let’s confirmed teams know when their next match and where it will be.
    * Centre-Pass means when the whistle is blown and the game starts.

* Venue Location Details
    * In the table above, it states where the games will be held. In this section, it notifies page visitors the address of each location, so they know exactly where their game will be.

* Sign Up Landing Page Image
    * Keeping consistent with each page starting with a netball-related image, it is supplemented with a cover text that directs users to a form below. Depending on the screen size this website is viewed on, it provides direction/instruction to a user to scroll down to see the form and acts as a prompt that they should complete the form.

* Sign Up Form
    * The sign up form consists of normal questions you would usually see when signing up to a league. 
    * It consists of the standard name, age, email and number. Age is asked for so page visitors who sign up as solo players can be placed into a team amongst similar aged players, where best possible. However, this field is not compulsory, hence there is no red asterisk indicating that it’s mandatory, as not all visitors want to disclose their age.
    * Email and mobile number is requested for contacting purposes, in case there are any updates or social events we need to inform all users about.
    * People can sign up as solo members as not everyone who is interested in joining the league will have a team ready. With the data submitted, In The Net can group solo sign ups into teams up to 10 (7 players, 3 reserves).
    * Same goes for team sign ups, not every team may have the necessary required number of players to play the game. If they have a team of 6 people ready to join, In The Net can match them with up to 4 people to join their team for the league.
    * Skill Level helps In The Net identify which games they should be paired with, to make the games as fair and as fun as possible. For team registrations, In The Net asks if the average skill level can be entered to minimise the number of sections a page visitor would need to complete. This is to help maximise form completions and payment.
    * There’s also an option for players to request to use the free equipment provided (bibs). This is usually covered with their sign up costs. If players have their own team kit they would like to use, they can do so and opt out of using free equipment.
    * The text area field allows page visitors to leave In The Net any comments they think we should regarding the league as they sign up. This could be a page visitor requesting if they can start the league later as they have prior commitments, such as an appointment or holidays.

### Features Left to Implement
* Burger menu
    * Using media queries and optimising the website to work for a mobile phone, the navigation links still appear underneath the logo and tagline. They aren’t congested on one line but it would be preferred to use a burger menu when the screen size is less than 768px wide.

* Real-time updates of games played and upcoming games
    * On the Home and Fixtures & Results page, it would be ideal to have the website dynamically update what game is upcoming and which team is currently ranking the top 10 spots.

* Men playing netball
    * On Google and Shutterstock, it was difficult to find a photo of men playing netball that fit the aesthetic of the website and/or colour scheme. This social league is open to everyone and wanted to make that clear on the homepage, so men feel included too.

* Feedback that the form has been submitted
    * Once a page visitor has completed the form and submitted it. It would be ideal if a message popped up that the form has successfully gone through or if it hasn’t. This feedback would give the page visitor confidence that they would be progressing to the payment stage or need to go back to the form and correct some details entered.
